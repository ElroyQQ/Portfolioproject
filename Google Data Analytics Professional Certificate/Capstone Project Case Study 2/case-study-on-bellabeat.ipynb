The products can be connected to the Bellabeat app for the user to access their data. There is also a Bellabeat subscription program that gives access to personalised guidance on health and wellness.The Chief Creative Officer has given the task to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. \n\nThe products available are \n* Leaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n* Time: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n* Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n\nFor this case study, we will select Leaf as the product to focus on as it is the basic model that has features our dataset can contribute insights to.\n\nThe Coursera case study details do not seem to be up to date with what Bellabeat is currently offering, it does not mention their newest product Ivy or details such as Leaf and Time tracking reproductive health. However, for the sake of simplicity we will use only the case study information.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <span style=\"color:#FA8072\"> 2. Prepare Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"prepare_phase_2\"></a> \n\n### 2.1 Details about the dataset used: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"details_dataset_2_1\"></a> \n\nThe dataset we are instructed to use is available on Kaggle, titled \"FitBit Fitness Tracker Data\" <https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit>\n\nMetadata about the data types and descriptions is available at <https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf>\n\n30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including daily activity, steps, heart rate, calories, sleep. weight that can be used to explore users’ habits. Data is available as 18 CSV files,  collected from 03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016  via survey by Amazon Mechanical Turk (crowdsourcing website for businesses).\n\nProvided under a free license CC0 1.00 Public Domain, by an experienced Kaggle user 'Möbius', therefore no restrictions from copywright or reliability of source (Second-party source).\n\nAs mentioned by the stakeholder in the case study, finding another dataset would be useful if possible. Preferably a larger dataset with more details such as fitbit for each user for a deeper exploration of any possible differences. Considering the focus of Bellabeat on women as a customer base, a female only dataset would be ideal. This dataset should ideally be open source as well, considering this project's limitations (Simulated case study of a fictional scenario by an individual) \nNo suitable dataset was available after a search, so only the previously mentioned dataset will be used for now.\n\n### 2.2 Data bias and credibility:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"data_credibility_and_integrity_2_2\"></a> \n\nThere is a concern of limited sample size, but 30 is the minimum number for a sample to represent the population by Central Limit Theorem. We can still proceed with this dataset.\n\nData is from 2016 and only for 2 months as well. Also, the metadata file states that not all data are automatically recorded, some are manually input by the user. Data from self-input surveys might have concerns of integrity.\n\nAccording to the data source on Zenodo(a general-purpose open-access repository), variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences. This might pose a problem of inconsistency in data collection, even though Fitbit is a reputable activity tracker brand.\n\nConsent was given as the data was collected via surveys. Privacy is not a concern as identifiers are not present.\nNo data as well on relevant information such as participants' demographic characteristics, lifestyle, time location, weather indicators, activity tracker usage frequency.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span style=\"color:#FA8072\">  3.

Act phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"act_phase_5\"></a>\n\n### 5.1 Key recommendations <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"key_recommendations_5_1\"></a>\n1. Healthy living goals with incentives in Bellabeat app.\n   * From the analyses on daily activity, the users do not meet the recommended daily requirements for daily steps and sedentary days significantly outnumber the other activity categories. This is a point to focus on for Bellabeat marketing of their smart devices, since it markets itself to be the \"go-to wellness brand for women with an ecosystem of products and services focused on women’s health\" according to its website.\n   * For example, Bellabeat can collaborate with other companies for their users to gain incentives in the form of discount vouchers when they hit specific goals. They can aim to work with other companies that promote healthy living such as those selling organic food, health supplements etc. The previous findings of positive correlations between calories expended vs total steps taken can be used in evidence-based messages in the app as well.\n   * As previously mentioned, there could also be a incentive to minimise time spent awake in bed, to promote healthy sleep habits for better wellness.\n   \n   \n2. Tracking healthy living progress over time\n   * In addition to the previous concept of health goals with incentives, the Bellabeat app can also include a daily or weekly progress report. The report would compare the user activity level and other metrics between each day and week, with additional stacking incentives for constant progress. The previous analysis showed that the users were inconsistent in meeting recommended activity and sleep quality throughout the week, this could be another selling point for Bellabeat as enabling the user to improve their health and wellness with positive reinforcement.\n   * This functionality could be integrated into the Bellabeat subscription program which already gives guidance on personal health and wellness. This would increase the appeal of it and encourage user retention to maintain their goal tracking.\n\nThe Leaf product is Bellabeat's classic health tracker, adding the functions above to it might raise awareness of it and improve sales and brand recognition.\n\n### 5.2 Limitations of analysis <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"limitations_analysis_5_2\"></a>\n* The analysis in this case study only uses daily data for activity and sleep, due to limitations in the remainder of the dataset.\n* For the other variables not used in the daily activity file, we could not make any other meaningful conclusions.\n* As previously mentioned, we could not find other useful datasets with larger sample sizes or more demographic data that could aid with analyses. Reproductive data such as menstrual cycle tracking would be most useful considering Bellabeat targets women for a customer base.\n\n### 5.3 Considerations for future analysis <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"considerations_future_5_3\"></a>\n* This case study is an academic one with limited resources and no real relationship with Bellabeat, if there could be an opportunity to work directly with the company the analysis could be taken to another level.\n* If a freely available dataset with more data such as on menstrual cycle tracking is available in the future, it would be interesting to revisit and explore this case study further.\n\n\nThank you for reading.","metadata":{}}]}
